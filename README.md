# Artificial Intelligence - Models

I explain the main learning and training approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

The topics are separated by folders to facilitate explanations, in each folder there is a README.md showing the steps and ideas behind all mathematics, including a project fully explained each line of code.

I made the explanations as simple as possible.

Any questions, just contact me:

## Linear Regression

- Algorithm with the purpose of drawing a future profile based on data from the past, a sequence of dataset to statistically predict a new result from results already seen in previous cases.
